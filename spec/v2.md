# HackerPug.com Landing Page Marketing Strategy

## Overview
Transform hackerpug.com from a personal portfolio into a high-converting consulting services landing page that positions Justin Rich as the go-to AI infrastructure expert for enterprise clients.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: CTOs, Engineering VPs, and Technical Directors at fast-growing startups and mid-stage companies
- **Secondary**: Product Managers and founders building AI-powered applications
- **Tertiary**: Companies struggling with AI implementation, scaling, or infrastructure challenges

## Value Proposition
**"Ship AI products faster with battle-tested infrastructure that scales"**

Positioning Justin as the consultant who bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and production-ready systems.

## Page Structure & Content Strategy

### 1. Hero Section
**Headline**: "Ship AI Products That Scale"
**Subheadline**: "I help companies build production-ready AI infrastructure that serves millions of users. From evaluation platforms to content generation systems, I've architected the backend systems that power tomorrow's AI applications."

**CTA**: "Book a Strategy Call" (primary) / "View Case Studies" (secondary)

**Visual**: Keep the pug mascot but make it more professional - perhaps the pug wearing developer headphones or sitting next to code/servers. Maintain the friendly but expert tone.

### 2. Social Proof Section
**"Trusted by Leading AI Companies"**

Feature 1-2 powerful client testimonials or results statements without company logos:

*"Reduced our AI model evaluation time by 60% while improving accuracy metrics across our entire platform."*
